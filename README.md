 Questions:

1. Installation of VS Code:

S Code is lightweight and should easily run on today's hardware. We recommend: 1.6 GHz or faster processor. 1 GB of RAM.
2. First-time Setup:
   - After installing VS Code, what initial configurations and settings should be adjusted for an optimal coding environment? Mention any important settings or extensions.
The first step we need to take is by downloading the Java SE Development Kit (JDK), which gives us all the core language files needed to get started coding in Java. Once you are at the download page, there will be multiple options based on which OS you are currently running.Prettier is one of the most popular VS Code extensions at the moment. It helps developers follow a standard style guide and maintain the same styles across the development team. With Prettier, you can quickly clean and format your code base to remove inconsistencies.
3. User Interface Overview:
   - Explain the main components of the VS Code user interface. Identify and describe the purpose of the Activity Bar, Side Bar, Editor Group, and Status Bar.
       Like many other code editors, VS Code adopts a common user interface and layout of an explorer on the left, showing all of the files and folders you have access to, and an editor on the right, showing the content of the files you have opened.
       Activity Bar is the core nagivation surface in VS Code
       Side bar -shows all views in the Primary Side Bar located to the left of the editor region.
      Editor group -t its heart, Visual Studio Code is a code editor. Like many other code editors, VS Code adopts a common user interface and layout of an explorer on the left, showing all of the files and folders you have access to, and an editor on the right, showing 
     the content of the files you have opened.
     Status bar Is Information about the opened project and the files you editing
4. Command Palette:
   - What is the Command Palette in VS Code, and how can it be accessed? Provide examples of common tasks that can be performed using the Command Palette.
      he Command Palette provides access to many commands. You can run editor commands, open files, search for symbols, and see a quick outline of a file, all using the same interactive window. Here are a few tips: Ctrl+P enables you to navigate to any file or symbol by typing its name.
5. Extensions in VS Code:
   - Discuss the role of extensions in VS Code. How can users find, install, and manage extensions? Provide examples of essential extensions for web development.
     let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your development workflow.Bring up the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of VS Code or the View:
     Exmaples -BrowserStack,Fakefiller,Loom

6. Integrated Terminal:
   - Describe how to open and use the integrated terminal in VS Code. What are the advantages of using the integrated terminal compared to an external terminal?
      You can also open the terminal via the right-click menu within the workspace: In the file explorer or editor, right-click on any file or empty space.Fully integrated terminals are generally more secure, as they are connected directly to the POS system and do not 
       rely on external servers or networks
7. File and Folder Management:
   - Explain how to create, open, and manage files and folders in VS Code. How can users navigate between different files and directories efficiently?
     he easiest way to create files and folders in VS Code is to use the New File and the New Folder buttons at the top of the Explorer View. The New File button is shaped like a piece of paper with a plus sign and the New Folder button is shaped like a folder with a 
      plus sign.you can open a workspace by using the File > Open Folder... menu, and then selecting a folder. Alternatively, if you launch VS Code from a terminal, you can pass the path to a folder as the first argument to the code command for opening.VS Code provides 
     two powerful commands to navigate in and across files with easy-to-use key bindings. Hold Ctrl and press Tab to view a list of all files open in an editor group. To open one of these files, use Tab again to pick the file you want to navigate to, then release Ctrl to open it.
8. Settings and Preferences:
   - Where can users find and customize settings in VS Code? Provide examples of how to change the theme, font size, and keybindings.
      To open the Settings editor, navigate to File > Preferences > Settings. Alternately, open the Settings editor from the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) with Preferences: Open Settings or use the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+,).
9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?
      TO run or debug a simple app in VS Code, select Run and Debug on the Debug start view or press F5 and VS Code will try to run your currently active file. However, for most debugging scenarios, creating a launch configuration file is beneficial because it allows you to configure and save debugging setup details.Conditional breakpoints
10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
      If your workspace is on your local machine, you can enable Git source control by creating a Git repository with the Initialize Repository command. When VS Code doesn't detect an existing Git repository, the Source Control view will give you the options to Initialize Repository or Publish to GitHub.To push your local changes to the remote repository, in the repository bar, click Push origin.
If there are commits on the remote branch that you don't have on your local branch, GitHub Desktop prompts you to fetch new commits from the remote.Add the files you want to commit to the staging area using: git add . or specify individual files by replacing . with the file names.
Commit your changes with a message: git commit -m "Initial commit"
